    <h3>Journal Entry</h3>

    <p>In 2026, I have established a comprehensive reading list comprising diverse titles, ranging from geopolitical non-fiction to classic novels which topic is interested. This decision is driven by a desire to restore cognitive discipline and counter the detrimental effects of modern technology. Primarily, this initiative aims to repair attention spans, reduce over-reliance on artificial intelligence, and foster genuine intellectual curiosity.</p>

    <p>The first significant motivation for this reading curriculum is the restoration of long-span concentration. In an era of fragmented information, the ability to focus on complex texts has notably diminished. By engaging with substantial works, such as Jared Diamond's historical analyses, one can retrain the brain to sustain attention for extended periods. Furthermore, this practice is essential for acquiring deep knowledge, which subsequently fosters critical thinking skills that are often neglected in favor of quick digital consumption.</p>

    <p>In addition to improving focus, a critical objective is to mitigate the growing dependence on artificial intelligence. While AI tools are powerful, excessive reliance on them can weaken biological memory systems, specifically the hippocampus. This phenomenon, often related to "transactive memory," suggests that offloading too much cognitive work to external sources reduces our own mental sharpness. Therefore, reading serves as a necessary exercise to maintain mental autonomy and ensure that human intelligence remains the primary driver of understanding.</p>

    <p>Finally, the intrinsic value of reading cannot be overlooked. Beyond the cognitive benefits, there is a profound satisfaction in fully grasping the subject matter of a book. Delving into a narrative or a complex argument stimulates the imagination in a way that passive media cannot. The sense of discovery experienced when immersing oneself in a book provides a unique intellectual reward that reinforces the habit of reading.</p>
